## Overview

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Replace this content with your actual project description -->

This IB Biology/Environmental Science investigation examined the health of Buffalo Bayou, a local waterway in Houston. Over 12 weeks, I collected and analyzed water samples to understand the ecosystem's condition.

## Research Question

*How do water quality parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrate levels, and turbidity) vary along a 2-mile stretch of Buffalo Bayou, and what do these variations indicate about pollution sources?*

## Methodology

### Sampling Protocol
- **Locations**: 5 sampling sites along a 2-mile stretch
- **Frequency**: Weekly samples for 12 weeks
- **Parameters measured**:
  - pH level
  - Dissolved oxygen (DO)
  - Nitrate concentration
  - Turbidity
  - Temperature

### Equipment Used
- Vernier water quality sensors
- Standard testing kits for backup verification
- GPS for precise location logging
- Field notebooks for observations

## Data & Analysis

| Site | Avg pH | Avg DO (mg/L) | Avg Nitrate (mg/L) | Avg Turbidity (NTU) |
|------|--------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 1 (Upstream) | 7.2 | 8.4 | 2.1 | 12 |
| 2 | 7.0 | 7.8 | 3.4 | 18 |
| 3 | 6.8 | 6.2 | 5.7 | 34 |
| 4 | 6.9 | 5.9 | 4.8 | 28 |
| 5 (Downstream) | 7.1 | 6.5 | 3.9 | 22 |

## Key Findings

1. **Site 3 showed concerning levels** of nitrate and turbidity, corresponding with a stormwater drain outlet
2. **Dissolved oxygen decreased** downstream from Site 1, suggesting organic pollution
3. **pH remained relatively stable** across all sites, within healthy range
4. **Seasonal variation** was observed, with higher turbidity during rainy periods

## Conclusions

The data suggests that urban runoff, particularly at Site 3, is impacting water quality. Recommendations include:
- Installing bioswales near the stormwater outlet
- Regular monitoring program by local environmental groups
- Community education about proper waste disposal

## Recognition

- Selected for presentation at the Texas Junior Science Symposium
- Article published in school science journal

## IB Criteria Addressed

This investigation fulfilled requirements for:
- Personal Engagement
- Exploration
- Analysis
- Evaluation
- Communication
