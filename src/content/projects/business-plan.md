## Overview

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Replace this content with your actual project description -->

EcoLunch was born from observing the massive amount of food waste generated daily in our school cafeteria. I developed a business plan that addressed this problem while creating educational opportunities for students.

## The Problem

Our school cafeteria generates approximately:
- 200 lbs of food waste per week
- $15,000 in annual food costs for items that get discarded
- Zero composting or food recovery programs

## The Solution

I proposed a three-pronged approach:

### 1. Food Recovery Program
Partner with local food banks to donate unexpired, untouched food items at the end of each day.

### 2. Student-Run Composting
Create an on-campus composting program managed by student volunteers, with compost used in the school garden.

### 3. Waste Tracking Dashboard
Implement a simple tracking system to measure progress and identify patterns in food waste.

## Business Model

| Revenue Stream | Projected Annual Value |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Cost savings from reduced food orders | $3,000 |
| Compost sales to local gardens | $500 |
| Grant funding (environmental initiatives) | $2,000 |
| **Total** | **$5,500** |

## Implementation

**Phase 1** (Months 1-2): Stakeholder buy-in, volunteer recruitment
**Phase 2** (Months 3-4): Pilot program with one lunch period
**Phase 3** (Months 5-6): Full rollout and partnership formalization

## Results

- Presented to school administration and received approval for pilot program
- Recruited 15 student volunteers
- Secured partnership with Houston Food Bank
- Currently in Phase 2 implementation

## Skills Developed

- Business plan writing and financial projections
- Public speaking and stakeholder presentations
- Team building and volunteer management
- Partnership development and negotiation
