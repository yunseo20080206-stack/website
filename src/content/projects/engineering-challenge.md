## Overview

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Replace this content with your actual project description -->

This project was part of our school's annual engineering design challenge. The goal was to create a bridge that could support maximum weight while using only sustainable and recycled materials.

## The Challenge

We were given the following constraints:
- Maximum bridge span: 50cm
- Materials: Only recycled or sustainable materials allowed
- Weight limit: Bridge must weigh under 200g
- Load requirement: Must support at least 10kg

## My Approach

I led a team of 4 students through the design process:

1. **Research Phase**: Studied various bridge designs (truss, arch, suspension) and their load-bearing characteristics
2. **Material Selection**: Chose recycled cardboard and bamboo skewers for optimal strength-to-weight ratio
3. **CAD Design**: Created 3D models to test different configurations
4. **Prototyping**: Built 3 iterations, testing each for weaknesses
5. **Final Build**: Constructed the winning design using lessons learned

## Results

- **Final weight**: 156g
- **Maximum load supported**: 47.8kg (over 300x its own weight!)
- **Placement**: 1st place in regional competition

## What I Learned

This project taught me valuable lessons about:
- Iterative design and the importance of prototyping
- Team leadership and delegation
- Applying physics principles to real-world problems
- Working within material and budget constraints
