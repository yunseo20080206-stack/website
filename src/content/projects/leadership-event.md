## Overview

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Replace this content with your actual project description -->

Recognizing the gap in STEM education access for younger students, I founded a mentorship program that pairs high school volunteers with middle school students for weekly learning sessions.

## The Need

Many middle school students in our area:
- Lack exposure to hands-on STEM activities
- Don't have access to tutoring resources
- Need positive role models interested in science and technology

## Program Structure

### Weekly Sessions (Every Saturday, 10am-12pm)

**Hour 1: Academic Support**
- Homework help in math and science
- Test preparation strategies
- Study skills development

**Hour 2: STEM Exploration**
- Hands-on experiments and projects
- Career exploration presentations
- Guest speakers from STEM fields

## My Responsibilities

As Program Founder and Lead Mentor:

1. **Curriculum Development**: Created 30+ lesson plans for hands-on activities
2. **Volunteer Recruitment**: Recruited and trained 12 high school mentors
3. **Partnership Building**: Established relationship with local middle school
4. **Logistics**: Coordinated space, materials, and scheduling
5. **Quality Assurance**: Observed sessions and provided feedback to mentors

## Impact

### By the Numbers (2023-2024 School Year)

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Mentees served | 35 |
| Volunteer mentors | 12 |
| Total session hours | 180 |
| Student satisfaction | 94% |
| Mentee grade improvement (avg) | +0.7 GPA in STEM subjects |

### Qualitative Outcomes

- 3 mentees joined their school's robotics club
- 8 mentees expressed increased interest in STEM careers
- Program featured in local newspaper
- Received school's Community Service Award

## CAS Reflection

This project addressed all three CAS strands:

- **Creativity**: Designing engaging curriculum and activities
- **Activity**: Organizing and running weekly sessions
- **Service**: Directly benefiting younger students in our community

## Sustainability

To ensure the program continues:
- Created comprehensive documentation and training materials
- Recruited and trained successor leadership team
- Established recurring partnership agreement with middle school
- Secured ongoing funding through school activity budget

## Future Goals

- Expand to additional middle schools
- Add virtual tutoring option
- Create summer intensive program
- Develop partnership with local tech companies for guest speakers
