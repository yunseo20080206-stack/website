# HOW TO ADD PROJECT IMAGES:

# 2. Reference it in your project's Markdown frontmatter:
#    thumbnail: "/images/projects/my-project.jpg"
#
# RECOMMENDED IMAGE SPECS:
# - Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
# - Size: 1200x630px (optimal for social sharing)
# - File size: Under 500KB for fast loading
#
# PLACEHOLDER IMAGES INCLUDED:

# in each project's .md file to match your image filenames.
